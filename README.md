Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained with backpropagation are biologically unrealistic but exceptionally adept at 'connecting the dots' in data. These networks are simpler to design, train, and test compared to biological brains, allowing for detailed examination down to each neuron and weight -- a feat that is implausible with biological brains. A growing trend within computational neuroscience is to train ANNs on simulated tasks to 'connect the dots', and then to compare their mechanisms with those of biological brains.

This project is an implemention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) that are designed for versatile applications in modeling various brain structures and biological constraints.
