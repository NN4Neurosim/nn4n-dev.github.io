- Added supports for multiple layers.
- Renamed `sparsity_constraints` as `sparsity_masks`.
- Renamed `positivity_constraints` as `ei_masks`.
- Added `plasticity_masks`, defines whether a connection is fixed throughout the training.
- Added `synapse_growth_masks`, defines whether a node could grow new synapses (whether an edge with zero value could change to nonzero).


#### Todos:
- [ ] Add custom constraint wrapper.
- [x] Change `visualize()` in the `nn4n.structure` to `plot_masks()`.
- [x] Change `masks()` in the `nn4n.structure` to `get_masks()`.
- [ ] Change the loss to functional forms. (e.g. function(model) -> loss). It might be better to also have a function that gets the specific model attributes (i.e., an interface cuz the model might change).
- [ ] Rename `criterion` to `constraint`.
- [ ] Change quickstart example to a more complex example.
- [x] Change `BaseStruct` to `BaseMask`.
- [ ] Change top icons to actual links
- [ ] The EIRNN example need to be change to the actual example.
