- Added supports for multiple layers.

- Renamed `positivity_constraints` as `ei_masks`.
- Added `plasticity_masks`, defines whether a connection is fixed throughout the training.
- Added `synapse_growth_masks`, defines whether a node could grow new synapses (whether an edge with zero value could change to nonzero).


#### Todos:

- [ ] Change `masks()` in the `nn4n.structure` to `get_masks()`.
- [ ] Change the loss to functional forms. (e.g. function(model) -> loss)
- [ ] Rename `criterion` to `constraint`.
- [ ] Change quickstart example to a more complex example.
- [ ] Change `BaseStruct` to `BaseMask`.
