- [x] ~~Add custom constraint wrapper.~~ Added `composite_loss` and seperate loss functions in the `criterion` module.
- [x] Add `plot_specs` and `get_specs` for masks.
- [x] Change `masks()` in the `nn4n.structure` to `get_masks()`.
- [x] ~~Change the loss to functional forms. (e.g. function(model) -> loss). It might be better to also have a function that gets the specific model attributes (i.e., an interface cuz the model might change).~~ See `composite_loss` and `criterion` module.
- [x] ~~Rename `criterion` to `constraint`.~~ Keep `criterion` as it is.
- [x] Change `BaseStruct` to `BaseMask`.
- [x] Change the network to use `batch_first` by default.
- [ ] Remove all `batch_first` related parameters. It is not the core feature and complicates the API.
- [ ] Add a `composer` module to compose complex networks.
- [ ] Add LSTM and GRU.
- [ ] Change quickstart example to a more complex example.
- [ ] Change top icons to actual links (forgot what I meant by this).
- [ ] The EIRNN example need to be change to the actual example.
- [ ] Remove the `deprecate` warnings.
- [ ] Add complex networks.
